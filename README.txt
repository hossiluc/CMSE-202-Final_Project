On This Project we explored different concepts of data manipulation and visualization.

We used folium to get our data visualized in maps

pandas for data manipulation


We got data from the following websites:




Deontae: Worked on the User-input "Choose your own adventure" functionality (part 3).
Lucas: Fixed all labeling issues with folium plot, and helped with web-scraping.
Maegan: Added in initial labels, cleaned up MasterNotebook, compiled the group code, and put together powerpoint.
Hunter: Web-scraped the data for our project using selector gadget, and begun a web server to visualize our plot.
Noah: Added in base code and ground work for the project, including implementation of the folium plot with the widget, and the color-maping.
